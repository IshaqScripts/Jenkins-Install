Install Jenkins:

Ensure that Jenkins is installed on your server or machine. You can download Jenkins from the official website: https://www.jenkins.io/download/.
Set Up Jenkins:

Once Jenkins is installed, open it in your web browser and complete the initial setup by following the on-screen instructions.
Install Necessary Plugins:

In Jenkins, install the necessary plugins for Git integration, Maven, and any other tools required for your Java project. You can install plugins from the Jenkins dashboard under "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins."
Create a New Jenkins Job:

Create a new Jenkins job to build and deploy your Java project.
Click on "New Item" on the Jenkins dashboard.
Enter a name for your job and choose the type of project (e.g., Freestyle project).
Click "OK."
Configure Source Code Management (SCM):

In the job configuration, go to the "Source Code Management" section.
Choose "Git" as the SCM.
Enter the repository URL and credentials if needed.
Configure Build Steps:

In the job configuration, go to the "Build" section.
Add a build step to execute Maven commands. For a typical Java project, use the "Invoke top-level Maven targets" build step.
Specify the Maven goals (e.g., clean install) and other options.
Configure Post-Build Actions:

In the job configuration, go to the "Post-build Actions" section.
Add actions to deploy your Java project. This may involve copying artifacts to a server, deploying to a container, or any other deployment steps.
Save and Run the Job:

Save the Jenkins job configuration.
Trigger a build manually to see if everything is set up correctly. Click "Build Now" on the Jenkins dashboard.
Monitor Build Status:

Monitor the build console output and check for any errors. Jenkins will display the progress and outcome of the build process.
Automate the Build Process:

Set up webhook integration or periodic polling in Jenkins to automatically trigger builds when changes are pushed to the Git repository.
Configure Additional Environments (Optional):

If you have multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production), consider setting up different Jenkins jobs or configurations for each environment.
Remember that the specific configuration details may vary depending on your project structure, dependencies, and deployment requirements. Adjust the Jenkins job configuration accordingly.
